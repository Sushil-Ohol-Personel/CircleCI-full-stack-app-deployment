### Hosting a Full-Stack Application

For this repo, I will take a full-stack app built for a retailer and deploy it to AWS so that it is available to customers. I will use the AWS to start and configure the services the app needs such as a database (AWS RDS), a web server (AWS Elastic Beanstalk), a site hosting (AWS S3).

This project is integrated with CircleCI for automating pipeline. It will also include documentation covering the operations of the deployment process. The documents will serve as a guideline to communicate with future developers and anybody involved in this app.
